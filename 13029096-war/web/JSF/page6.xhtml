                Navigation is important feature of any web application. A visitor may need to navigate to 
                other resources using simple HTML link or submit form data that need to be processed by clicking a button.
                Internally JSF framework needs to work out which JSF page to be rendered based on an action. 
                In JSF there are three different options to define page navigation.
            </p>
            <h3>Implicit Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                JSF allows implicit navigation which means that only the view name
                needs to be put in action attribute of a command button or link. In this case
                JSF will search and correct view name my appending .xhtml extension to it.
            </p>
            <h3>Auto Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                A method from a managed bean can be used that returns a view name as
                string. This method can be used to do conditional navigation.
            </p>
            <h3>Explicit Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                In explicit navigation, navigation rules are defined in faces-config.xml file. 
                Using explicit navigation same outcome from different source can be mapped to different views.
